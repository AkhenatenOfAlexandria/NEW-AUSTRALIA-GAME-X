# NEW-AUSTRALIA-GAME-X
The Game of New Australia

This Game is patterned on a tutorial, but it has deviated enough that it is hard to fix bugs.

As of May 11, 2023, entity collision does not affect anything but the debug information. The player is supposed to destroy potions and his punch is supposed to damage karens.
